# Cool-Lines
This program was designed to calculate line equation given two points. However, it has many reusable features such as a class for operations on simple fractions or a class which represents a point in a 2D space.\
**A few words of caution:**
1) The makefile was written from the top of my head and has not been tested!
2) Numerator should be separated from denominator by a *whitespace*, not a comma, as incorrectly stated in the program! 
# This is how the program looks like when executed
